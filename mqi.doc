\title{mqi -- Python and Other Programming Languge Integration for SWI Prolog}
\author{Eric Zinda \\
	E-mail: \email{ericz@inductorsoftware.com}}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}

This package provides the library \file{mqi.pl} that enables embedding
SWI Prolog into just about any programming language (Python, Go, C\#,
etc) in a straightforward way. It is designed for scenarios that need to
use SWI Prolog as a local implementation detail of another language.
Think of it as running SWI Prolog ``like a library''. It can support any
programming language that can launch processes, read their STDOUT pipe,
and send and receive JSON over TCP/IP.

A Python 3.x library is provided.
